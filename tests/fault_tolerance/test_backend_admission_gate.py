"""Process-level coverage for the shared backend admission gate.

The gate lives in `Ingress::handle_payload_shared`, the one admission point both
request planes funnel through, so a CPU-only mocker worker exercises the real
thing over TCP and NATS alike.

The oracle here is the worker's own `dynamo_backend_admission_*` family, scraped
from its system port. HTTP is only a coarse cross-check: an admitted request
answers `200` and a refused one answers something else. Which typed error and
status a refusal maps to belongs to the response transport, not to the gate, and
is deliberately not pinned by these tests.

Observation is metrics-driven rather than sleep-driven: each step polls until the
gauges show the state it needs, and counters are asserted as deltas from a
baseline taken after readiness, never as process-global absolutes. Fixed sleeps
appear only where the point is to separate two deadlines by a safe margin.

Each scenario runs one mocker and one frontend of its own, on ports from
`dynamo_dynamic_ports`, and shares only the session-scoped NATS and etcd, so the
whole file is safe under xdist process parallelism; each mocker keeps its own
generated discovery namespace. `MockerProcess` and `FrontendRouterProcess` both
snapshot `os.environ` in their constructors, which is why the gate configuration
is patched around construction alone — the parallelism here is between
processes, never threads mutating one environment.
